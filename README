Validations
===========

A collection of common validations that I have call to use in web
applications. I've tried to keep the validations as "correct" as possible.

Example
=======

With the plugin installed, the following validations are available

validates_hostname_format_of
validates_fully_qualified_domain_name_format_of
validates_email_address_format_of
validates_url_format_of
